# Children’s engagement with the outdoors and sports activities   

This is the final project page for my **Telling Stories with Data** Class at Carnegie Mellon University.

# ***Part I***    
**Outline**  
Changes in current societies are affecting childhood experiences. Time for outdoor play is diminishing, contributing to more sedentary lifestyles, disconnected from the natural world. However, spending time outdoors and doing some physical activities participating has been attributed to improving a child’s short- and long-term well-being(Children’s Society, 2013). My main topic in this final project is that I want my audience to look at how children are spending their leisure time on sports and outdoor activities. As a reader, I want to reader get to know the importance of outdoor activities for children and know their children's' preference. Of their outdoor leisure activities, taking part in sport is by far the most popular among 8- to 15-year-olds. Boys spend significantly longer than girls on sport but interestingly, boys and girls who do participate in sport, enjoy it equally. I will use several graphs to visualize the whole data or some of interesting part to convey a vivid and clear data visualization to my audience.  

*Source: This is an analysis conducted by the latest UK Harmonised European Time Use Survey which defines children as those aged 8 to 15 years.*  

**Main Elements/ Points of this Final Project**  
  * Boys spend more time participating in sports activities than girls: Boys spent significantly longer on sports activities at 40 minutes per day on average compared with 25 minutes per day for girls. Boys were also more likely to participate in sports activities than girls, with a daily participation rate of 38.8% compared with 26.4% for girls.  
  * 14- to 15-year-olds are less likely to spend time in parks, countryside, seaside, beach or coastal locations than younger children. The average daily leisure time children aged 8 to 15 years in the UK in 2014 to 2015 spent in parks, countryside, seaside, beach or coastal locations was 16 minutes. Whilst there was no significant difference in the average daily time spent at these locations between age groups or between boys and girls, those aged 14 to 15 years were significantly less likely to visit these locations than children aged 8 to 10 years.   
  
**Datasets**

This data was collected from April 2014 to December 2015. Children aged 8 and over were asked to complete time diaries on two days – one weekday and one weekend day. The survey captured a representative sample of children living in private residential households in the UK during this period. By clicking the link, you can download the data, and it contains several tables, which is the summary data by category for the whole survey.  
The time measured in this report/ survey is the average time that takes into account all children aged 8 to 15 in the survey whether or not they participate in this activity. Participation rates refer to the proportion of children who took part in an activity as a percentage of all children aged 8 to 15 surveyed on any given day.

**Method and medium**  
I will use Shorthand to deliver my whole final project because I think it is a convenient tool to help us visualized our data and conveyed our ideas. We can use a very narrative way to explaining our data from simple to complex.  

By inserting interesting pictures and our graphs, we can give our audience a better understanding of our idea and data.

I am hoping I can create excellent and meaningful data visualization to my audience in the next two weeks. Let's wait and see!
